# Anomaly_Detection
SHM using Neural_Network
This model demonstartes a tiny version use case for Anomaly Detection using Autoencoder. 
The train dataset is the vibrations data from Z-24 bridge before and after the anomaly occured.
Accuracy model demonstartes the accuracy params and visuals of the model.
